# Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

This code repository is for the reproducibility of TPAMI submission paper "Diversity Maximization for Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting in One-Shot Neural Architecture Search".

This code is built based on "NAS-Bench-201" dataset, please refer NAS-Bench-201.md for the use of NAS-Bench-201.



The genral algorithm is in './exps/algos/GDAS_NSAS_xxxx.ipynb' and './exps/algos/random_NAS_NSAS_xxxx.ipynb' 

and the comparison results are also in those folds './exps/algos/GDAS_results' and './exps/algos/RandomNAS_results'
